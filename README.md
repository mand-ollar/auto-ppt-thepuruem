# The Puruem Media PPT Template
To simplify the process of making PPT every week, made a PPT template.  
Named all Slide Master layouts and all sections. You can see some placeholders in each layouts.

## Purpose
The ultimate goal of this project is to automate the PPT-making-process.  
Using pptx-python library from Python, we can control PPT with Python code.

## Requirements

### Fonts
Chalkduster, SB Aggro, Dreaming Outloud Pro, Footlight MT, Gowun Batang, BM Yeonsung, 210 Soopilmyungjo, Nanum Gothic, Gowun Dodum are required.  
Chalkduster, Dreaming Outloud Pro, Footlight MT are default. (MAYBE)

### Python Libraries
If you want to write and edit a code for automation process,  
please install these Python libraries and needless to say, Python also.  
  
In this project, we used pptx-python, pathlib, json, time, re, requests, beautifulsoup4(bs4)  
You have to install pptx-python, requests, beautifulsoup4(bs4). Otherwise, I bet it is installed when you install Python.  
  
Here is a guide that will help using this library. [pptx-python](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  

### ETC.
A little bit of knowledge w.r.t. Python (if you want to understand and edit the code)  
Otherwise, you don't have to give a shit XD ...  

## How It Works

### What you have to prepare
You may have to prepare:  
1) PPT Template file that the named layouts are prepared in Slidemaster.
2) TXT file that includes PPT sequence.
3) JSON file that includes the information about the session.
  
But even if you don't do these, it will give you the guidelines.  

### Process
If you run the code, you can see the instructions. You can just kindly follow them.  
  
1) It gets the layout sequence information from TXT file.
2) It gets the detailed information of the session from JSON file.
3) Create PPT file from the sequence and the detailed information.
